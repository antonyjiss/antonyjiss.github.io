									<p>Hi there! My name is Jiss, and I am a Data Analyst with a passion for analyzing and interpreting data to drive 
										  insightful decisions. I recently moved to Canada with Permanent Residency after spending several years in UAE,
										   where I worked in sales and business development analyst. However, it was during the post-Covid period that I discovered 
										   my true calling.</p>
									<p>My boss entrusted me with tasks related to product and price analyses, 
										which helped management finalize a competitive price that became a successful launch. 
										This experience sparked my interest in big data, and I began to analyze branch sales reports to identify 
									 SWOT analyses and pinpoint the right category of products for the right customers. Additionally, while applying for 
										Canada PR, I conducted an analysis that helped us predict our PR score and timeline for the next invitation. 
										We were able to prepare our score and files accordingly, and the actual invitation came in on the predicted score and 
										timeline.</p>
									<p>These experiences inspired me to find a passion in big data analyses, and I decided to pursue my career specialized in this field. I took a career break to relocate 
										to Canada with my partner over PR and fortify the data analytics skills. I have a Bachelor's degree in Commerce, MBA from Bedfordshire UK, 
								and I have recently completed 
										 the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Although I have less work experience as Data Analyst, 
										 I completed a case study as part of the Google Data Analytics course capstone, which has given me a taste of what 
										 being a Data Analyst is all about.
										I believe in the power of hard work and determination, and my experience with the Google Data Analytics course 
										has reinforced this belief. I put in a lot of effort and hard work into my studies, and it has given me the confidence
										 to believe that anything is possible with dedication and effort. </p>
									<p>As a Data Analyst, I am eager to learn and grow, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in this field. 
										I am confident that my education, work experience, and drive will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to any 
										organization that I work for. I am excited to see where this career takes me, and I am ready to tackle any challenge 
										that comes my way with enthusiasm and dedication! </p>
									<p>In my free time, I enjoy pursuing my hobbies, including photography, planting, and my all-time favorite game - frisbee! 
										I also love to engage in DIY projects, which help me stay creative and mentally refreshed. 
										I believe that pursuing our passions and hobbies is essential for success in any profession, and it has certainly helped
										 me maintain a positive outlook and a healthy work-life balance. 
										<br>I am now excited to re-enter the workforce and apply 
										my knowledge and experience as a data analyst</p>
